        Creates a `PurchaseOrders` instance from a list of purchase order codes.

        This method is designed to generate purchase order entities based solely on the codes
        obtained from a tender. Each code is used to create a `PurchaseOrder` instance, representing
        a purchase order with its associated code.

        These initial entities only contain the code and can later be used to retrieve or populate
        additional attributes as needed.

            PurchaseOrders: An instance of `PurchaseOrders` containing a list of `PurchaseOrder`
            entities created from the provided codes.
